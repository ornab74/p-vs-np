CHUNK 5 — Collapsing the Audit Model (Progress Toward P vs NP)
Date: 2025-12-24

Goal:
Show that any circuit computing L_mix^hash must pass the strengthened audit suite,
or else derive a contradiction with correctness on a non-negligible measure of inputs.

Strategy:
1) Necessity of Witness Verification:
   Any correct circuit for L_mix^hash must be correct on accepting inputs; if it
   outputs 1 without a valid witness, we can locally verify falsity by checking
   clique and SAT constraints. Therefore, either the circuit emits a witness or
   is refutable on a polynomially checkable set—contradicting correctness.

2) Necessity of Focus Normal Form:
   On inputs with a unique witness C*, the value of the language is invariant under
   removal of edges not supporting C*. Any correct circuit must be invariant under
   H -> H⟨C*⟩ on accepting paths, or else it disagrees with the language on a
   polynomially verifiable transformation.

3) Necessity of Block Resampling Stability:
   On focused instances H⟨C*⟩, the language value is independent of off-clique blocks.
   If a circuit changes output when resampling an off-clique block with non-negligible
   probability, this yields a pair of efficiently constructible instances with
   identical language value but differing circuit output—violating correctness.

4) Necessity of Seed Resampling Stability:
   Hash seeds that preserve h_S(C*) define an equivalence class on which the language
   value is constant. Any circuit depending on irrelevant seed bits disagrees on
   two instances with identical language value, again violating correctness.

Conclusion:
For any circuit that is correct on a 1 - 1/poly fraction of inputs drawn from the
natural distribution, failing any of the audits implies detectable error on a
polynomially checkable set of instances. Hence correctness forces audit compliance
up to negligible error.

Status:
- This does not yet prove that *all* P/poly circuits pass the audits unconditionally,
  but it shows that audit failure implies a structured, efficiently testable error.
- Combined with amplification, this strongly suggests that the audit model captures
  an intrinsic property of correctness for L_mix^hash.

Next steps:
- Formalize each necessity implication as a reduction from audit failure to explicit
  counterexample construction.
- Quantify measure bounds to lift from distributional correctness to worst-case.
