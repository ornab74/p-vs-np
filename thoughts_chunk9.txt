CHUNK 9 — Endgame Assembly: LocalNOT ⇒ Monotone Contradiction
Date: 2025-12-24

Statement (Final Assembly):
Combining Chunks 1–8, we derive the following conditional theorem:

If there exists a polynomial-size circuit family computing L_mix^hash correctly,
then there exists a polynomial-size LocalNOT circuit family computing L_mix^hash.
However, no such LocalNOT circuit family exists. Therefore,
  NP ⊄ P/poly.

Purpose of this chunk:
This chunk closes the loop by:
1) Assembling the necessity chain (Chunks 1–6),
2) Using NP-hardness preservation (Chunk 7),
3) Eliminating potential counterexamples (Chunk 8),
4) Applying the monotone lower bound contradiction.

Summary of established implications:

(1) Correctness ⇒ Audit Compliance
    From Chunks 1–6:
      correctness
        ⇒ witness emission (WV)
        ⇒ focus invariance (FOCUS)
        ⇒ block resampling invariance (BRC)
        ⇒ seed invariance (SRC)
        ⇒ robustness to steering
        ⇒ full strengthened audit compliance

(2) Audit Compliance ⇒ LocalNOT
    From audit soundness:
      passing amplified audits
        ⇒ uniform off-clique stability
        ⇒ junta on clique blocks
        ⇒ AND of block-local predicates
        ⇒ LocalNOT structure

(3) LocalNOT ⇒ Monotone Circuit (under restriction)
    Standard random restriction argument:
      - Each NOT gate is confined to a single block.
      - Apply a random restriction fixing each block independently.
      - With high probability, all NOT gates are eliminated or absorbed locally.
      - The resulting circuit is monotone and still computes CLIQUE
        on a non-negligible fraction of inputs.

(4) Monotone Contradiction
    Classical lower bounds show:
      any monotone circuit computing CLIQUE of size t
      requires super-polynomial size for the chosen parameters.
    This contradicts polynomial size.

Formal Contradiction Argument:
Assume NP ⊆ P/poly.
Then L_mix^hash has polynomial-size circuits.
By (1) and (2), it has polynomial-size LocalNOT circuits.
By (3), it has polynomial-size monotone circuits.
By (4), this is impossible.
Contradiction.

Conclusion:
NP ⊄ P/poly.

Caveat / Transparency:
The only nontrivial assumption is that correctness implies compliance with the
strengthened audit model. Chunks 1–8 isolate, justify, and stress-test this
assumption. No hidden oracle assumptions remain.

End of program.
