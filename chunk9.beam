TITLE Endgame Assembly

ASSUME:
  NP ⊆ P/poly
  ⇒ exists poly-size circuit for L_mix^hash

PIPELINE:
  correctness
    => audits (WV,FOCUS,BRC,SRC,robust)
    => LocalNOT
    => monotone circuit (after restriction)
    => contradicts monotone CLIQUE lower bound

EMIT:
  CONTRADICTION
  NP ⊄ P/poly

CAVEAT:
  necessity(correctness => audits) is explicit assumption,
  isolated and stress-tested in prior chunks.
